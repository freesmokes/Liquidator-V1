# Liquidator-V1
A liquidator script for the QIDAO Protocol on the Polygon Network.


## Setup
In order for this script to work, you will need to setup a Python3 environment of your own. Once done, you will need to pip install web3 in order to be fully functional. Lastly, you will need to to fill out 3 variables at the top of the script with you own information, ex. need to fill url variable with a Polygon RPC endpoint, myAddress variable with your Polygon address and and the priv variable with your private key. Once done with all of these setup steps, you can run the bot and have a chance at getting some liquidations!


## Info
This is not a competitive liquidation bot and will only win liquidations if other bots let some liquidations fall through the cracks. I am releasing this code for the benefit of the protocol and to provide ideas to other users. Users running this bot do have the chance to benefit from liquidations but it is quite small. As such, I would not run this bot as is. This script is more beneficial for learning purposes, but again it does function properly, just not quickly so it can be used as is if you do not care to be competitive in liquidations but more to help the protocol stay solvent.
